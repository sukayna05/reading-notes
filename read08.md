there are 3 types of logical operator
not !
or **double	**
and &&
types of copmression operators
== equal
!= not equal
=== strict equal
!== not strict equal
< less than
> larger than
>= larger or equal
<= less or equal
we use this operators in loops if the condition is true then the loop can run
the loop keep running till the codition is false

there is 3 types of loops
FOR
WHILE
DO WHILE
if we want to loop for specific nubmer we use for
if we want to loop for non-specific number we use while -and we use do while as we use while but do while will run the code one time before checking the condition is true or false.
